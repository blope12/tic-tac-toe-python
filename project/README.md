Tic-Tac-Toe Text-Based Game
========================================================================================================================================================================================================
Overview
This project implements a text-based version of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe using Python. The game is played in the terminal or command prompt using keyboard input. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, aiming to create a line of three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game supports two players, and it ends when one player wins or when the board is filled with no winner (a draw).

Files

tictactoe.py: This file contains the main implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. It uses the curses library to create a text-based user interface in the terminal. The game logic, including checking for a winner and detecting draws, is implemented here. The start_game function initializes the game and handles player input, while other helper functions like make_move, check_winner, and check_draw manage the game state.
tests.py: This file contains unit tests for the functions in tictactoe.py. It uses the pytest framework to define and run the tests. The tests ensure that the game functions behave as expected under different conditions. For example, test_make_move checks if making a move on the board updates the board correctly, test_check_winner verifies the correctness of the winner detection logic, and test_check_draw ensures that the draw condition is properly detected.

Design Choices
Text-Based Interface: The decision to use a text-based interface was made to keep the project simple and accessible. Using the curses library allows creating a basic UI in the terminal without requiring any additional dependencies.
Modular Design: The code is organized into separate functions for different aspects of the game (e.g., input handling, game logic). This modular design enhances readability, maintainability, and testability. Each function has a clear purpose, making it easier to understand and modify the code as needed.
Unit Testing: Unit tests were implemented to verify the correctness of individual functions in isolation. This approach helps catch bugs early and ensures that changes to the code don't introduce unintended side effects. The pytest framework was chosen for its simplicity and flexibility in defining test cases.
Error Handling: The code includes basic error handling to handle invalid input from the user (e.g., attempting to place a mark on an already occupied cell). Error messages are not explicitly displayed to the user in the current implementation but could be added for improved usability in future iterations.
Scalability: While the current implementation supports a 3x3 grid and two players, the design allows for easy extension to larger grids or additional players if desired. However, for simplicity, the focus remained on the classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game.

The Tic-Tac-Toe text-based game project provides a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic game in Python. Through modular design, unit testing, and thoughtful design choices, the project demonstrates good software engineering principles. While the current version offers basic functionality, there is potential for further enhancements and extensions to make the game more enjoyable and feature-rich.
